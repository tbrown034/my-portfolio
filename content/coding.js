Built a modern Next.js site from scratch with a blog, practice highlights and an appointment request form that instantly notifies the doctor. Now manage $2K/month ad budget and more than tripled new patient revenue in the last year through targeted Google Ads campaigns with detailed conversion tracking.",

Users can return to see if their food is still fresh, near deadline, or needs to go. Built with Next.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and OpenAI API for intelligent food management.",

That gave me the idea for ReStub â€“ an app that lets users enter details of MLB, NBA, NFL and NHL games they attended, no matter how far back. Uses Anthropic AI integration to automatically look up and fill in missing game details. Hoping to add photo upload feature soon.",
