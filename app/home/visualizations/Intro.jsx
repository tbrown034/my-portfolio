              I've always thought of myself as a data-driven reporter through
              the years â€“ whether teaching myself the cooler parts of Excel, or
              learning Datawrapper, Tableau and other visualization tools.
              Visual storytelling has been a constant thread in my journalism
              career.

              Now I use tools, including JavaScript and Python libraries, to
              transform datasets into stories that reveal patterns, trends and
              insights. Every chart and graphic is another way to tell a story.
