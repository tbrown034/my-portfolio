            I've always thought of myself as a data-driven reporter through the years â€“ whether teaching myself the cooler parts of Excel, or learning Datawrapper, Tableau and other visualization tools. Data storytelling has been a constant thread in my journalism career.

                Now I use tools, including JavaScript and Python libraries, to transform datasets into stories that reveal patterns, trends and insights that might otherwise remain hidden in spreadsheets. Every chart and graphic is another way to hold power accountable.

                My approach centers on making complex data accessible through interactive visualizations, 
                always with an eye toward clarity and user experience. Whether it's election results, 
                budget analysis, or demographic trends, the goal is always the same: help people understand 
                what the numbers actually mean.
