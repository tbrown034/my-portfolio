        I am available for full-time or freelance work in both journalism and
        web development â€” or something involving both!

        I didn't know exactly what was in store for me when I decided to quit my
        journalism job in 2022 and chart a new career path for myself. But I'm
        ready to build and continue my web development journey. With a passion
        for storytelling and a knack for coding, I'm eager to merge these worlds
        and create impactful digital experiences.
      </p>
      <p className="text-xl leading-normal font-robotoSlab">
        If you're looking for someone with a unique blend of storytelling and
        technical skills, or just want to share ideas and collaborate, please
        don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always open to new opportunities and
        challenges.
