        I am available for full-time or freelance work in both journalism and
        web development â€” or something involving both!
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn't know exactly what was instore for myself when I decided to quit
        my journalism job in 2022 and chart a new career path for myself. But
        I'm ready to build and continue my web development journey. With a
        passion for storytelling and a knack for coding, I'm eager to merge
        these worlds and create impactful digital experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're looking for someone with a unique blend of storytelling and
        technical skills, or just want to share ideas and collaborate, please
        don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always open to new opportunities and
        challenges.
